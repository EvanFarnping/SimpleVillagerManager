# SimpleVillagerManager
Have the ability to remove villagers from chunks (new or old). There are also other custom things that can be configured if desired. Also, this plugin was created to fix the fact that villagers spawned at villages during chunk generation are not considered a "CreatureSpawnEvent" thus, a special chunk event handler had to be created.
